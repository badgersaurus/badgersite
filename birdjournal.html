    <h1>BIRDWATCHING JOURNAL</h1>
	<p>This page serves as a sort-of digital log of all my birdwatching trips.<br>
	Each entry includes the date, the location, a list of birds I saw or heard, approximate counts of those birds, and a short written section on my thoughts and experience. It may also include photos if I got any good ones, but I don't have a proper camera so they're not the best. Just remember the views in real-life were much much MUCH nicer.</p>
