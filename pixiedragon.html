    <h1>PIXIE DRAGON</h1>
	<img src="art/pixie-dragon-1.jpg" width="400px">
	<p>Perhaps the most unusual of all the dragons, the Pixie Dragon is a fine example of the oddness of Australian wildlife. The last surviving member of the forest-dragon clade, it's arboreal habits, colourful scales, and nocturnal schedule stand in direct contrast to the lifestyles of other large reptiles.<br>
	Chittering away in it's treetop home during the day, the Pixie clambers over branches with it's claws and prehensile tail, keeping a watchful eye over it's flock. When dusk falls, it takes to the skies, fluttering after moths and birds in a discordant, excitable fashion. A perfectly-adapted night-time hunter, it has no difficulty finding prey thanks to it's huge eyes and agile build; some scientists say it may even be capable of echolocation.</p>

   <table> <!--Sweet table-y goodness. No fancy tricks here. Consult the w3schools documentation if you get lost.-->
   	<tr>
	 <th>Habitat:</th>
	 <td>Forested bush across Australia.</td>
	</tr>
    <tr>
	 <th>Size:</th>
	 <td>The smallest dragon species; around the size of a domestic housecat. Specifics TBD.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	 <th>ID:</th>
	 <td>Unique semi-bipedal stance, comparable to that of a monkey or koala-bear. Thin jaws lined with small teeth, ending in a hooked beak. Huge, gecko-like eyes, set in a round head. Wings are distinctly 'insectoid' in shape, with no extra fingers. Lacks horns entirely. Long, quill-like back spines are black with an iridescent sheen. Prehensile tail used to grip branches while climbing.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	 <th>Colour:</th>
	 <td>Dusty-pink or pale-blue scales, paper-yellow wings. Spines are iridescent-black.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	 <th>Habits:</th>
	 <td>Nocturnal in nature; spends the daytime resting in trees or on telephone-posts. Awakens at dusk to hunt insects and small birds. Highly social; can be seen resting in groups of up to thirty individuals. Distinct chittering calls. Energetic, fluttering flight unique amongst dragons, as are most of the pixie dragon's features.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	 <th>Diet:</th>
	 <td>Various nocturnal insects, such as moths, cicadas, grasshoppers etc. Small birds may also be taken. Known to scavenge from larger carrion when the oppurtunity arises.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	 <th>Nesting:</th>
	 <td>Males fly high in the air before rapidly diving, a courting act similar to that of certain hummingbirds. Female lays two-to-three eggs in a woven nest made from twigs, mud, and grasses, lined with animal hair or softer plants, and located upon a tree branch. Eggs are pale-blue in colour and hatch after four weeks. Young stay within their tree until they are able to fly, and are raised by both parents.</td>

   <h2>NOTES</h2>
   <p>The Pixie Dragon started as a simple doodle of a gecko-dragon I immediately fell in love with. I wanted my fictional dragon universe to have some kind of weirdo Australian species and I just knew these guys had to be it.<br>
   Their iridescent spines are an opaque reference to the Australian aboriginal mythological figure of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_Serpent">Rainbow Serpent.</a> The species was named both for it's cutesy appearance and for the garage-rock band the Pixies, who I adore.</p>
   <p>The Pixie Dragon takes biological inspiration from the arboreal, nocturnal lifestyles of possums and geckos, and the insect-hunting methods of nighthawks. The popular idea of the Australian continent as an isolated place known for it's wholly unique wildlife was another major inspiration.</p>
   <p>For those curious about fictional dragon taxonomy, the forest-dragons are a group consisting of mostly-extinct species known for their smaller size and.. well.. extinct-ness. The Pixies are the only living member of the clade, though their relatives were once spread throughout southeast Asia.</p>
