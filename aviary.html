   <h1>AVIARY</h1>
   <p>I like birds.<br>
   I've liked birds since I was a little kid (some of my earliest memories are of drawing pictures of robins and magpies) but I only started formally birdwatching around Spring 2021, thanks to my dad.<br>
   Though I haven't been at it for very long, it has quickly become one of my favourite hobbies. It's a great excuse to get outdoors, an excellent way to meet new people, and a practically neverending source of humour, beauty and wonder.<br>
   It's also totally easy to get into:<br>
   all you need is access to a city-park, and a guidebook or free phone app.<br>
   (A monocular helps, too. I also use <a href="https://www.scythebill.com/">Scythebill</a> for recordkeeping.)</p>
   <p>Here, you can find a log of all my birdwatching trips, and my life-list.<br>
   I plan to update this section of the site with new species and journal-entries every time I head out birdwatching. That's usually weekly in the summer and spring.<br>
   So check back here often. Make Badgersaurus a part of your daily internet-routine. Artificially boost my page-view numbers. Please.
