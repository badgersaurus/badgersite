    <h1>SURFIN'</h1>
	<p>This page is the edge or perhaps 'coast' of the website, where you can catch a wave out to some other place in cyberspace. Totally radical!</p>
			<img src="blinkies/computer.png">
	<p>This page is meant to be a little different from usual personal web linkpages, instead hoping to mimick pre-search-engine link directories in breadth with lots and lots of both useful and useless links to explore. Why? Because AI SEO slop has made searching for things a chore and I have an absolutely massive collection of bookmarks. The Internet is still a magical place full of free information and entertainment unsurpassed by anything else in human history but you sure wouldn't know it if you still used Google everyday.<br>
	If more people could maintain Yahoo-style link indexes again, the web would be a much more pleasant place to be. It would replace a system based on spam and speed with one based on quality, ease-of-use, and enjoyment--in other words, the things humans like that a robot can't quantify. <3</p>

	<h2>USEFUL STUFF</h2>
	<h3 id="info">Information and Guides</h3>
	<p><strong><a href="https://htmldog.com" target="_parent">HTMLDog</a></strong><br>
	Basic HTML, CSS and Javascript explained better than anywhere else.</p>
	<p><strong><a href="https://www.succeedsocially.com/" target="_parent">Succeed Socially</strong></a><br>
  A long, long list of ways to talk to people, for all the gen-Z jerkoffs raised on phones who never really learnt how. Unfortunately there is an epidemic of this and it is only going to get worse. Help yourself help yourself!</p>
  <p><strong><a href="https://darebee.com/" target="_parent">Darebee</a></strong><br>
  Free at-home workouts sortable in the usual ways (difficulty, type, muscle group etc.) as well as 30-day challenges, ideas for workout plans etc.<br>
  I like this one a lot because they have a lot of good stuff for absolute beginners and because the still-image/PDF formats means you can see the whole workout (and therefore anything you might need to substitute/change) at a glance instead of clicking a Youtube video and praying.</p>
  <p><strong><a href="https://www.thetarotguide.com/learn-tarot/" target="_parent">The Tarot Guide</a></strong><br>
  There are a lot of tarot-reading guides but this is the one I use for card meanings.</p>
	<h3 id="tools">Web Tools</h3>
	<p><strong><a href="https://www.random.org/" target="_parent">Random.org</a></strong><br>
	Random number generation, list picking, etc.</p>
	<h3 id="soft">Software Downloads</h3>
	<p>All 100% FREE as in beer and like 80% FREE as in speech. I use most of these on a daily basis.</p>
	<p><strong><a href="https://floorp.app/" target="_parent">Floorp Browser</a></strong><br>
	Firefox fork with a funny name and a funny sidebar where you can put any website. Also some other customization features and power-user stuff. Mostly I just like the name honestly. I'm a simple woman.</p>
	<p><strong><a href="https://obsidian.md/" target="_parent">Obsidian</a></strong><br>
	Go-anywhere do-anything linkable markdown notes software, with plugins and themes to be as complicated or simple as you'd like. I don't really use it anymore but it's fantastic and I basically ran all my organization with it for years.</p>
	<p><strong><a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/" target="_parent">Notepad++</a></strong><br>
	Programming-oriented text-editor. Also has iconic slacktivism update titles. And a chameleon mascot!<br>
	Every Badgersaurus update goes through here before going on the Web.</p>
	<p><strong><a href="https://rclone.org/" target="_parent">RClone</a></strong><br>
	Computer data backups are a lot like birth-control: sometimes you can theoretically get away without using it but the potential consequences for <em>not</em> using it are enough to make you never take the risk.<br>
	This is by far the simplest free tool I've found for 'em. Uploads to any cloud database (or other drive) you'd like, can exclude any files or folders within a given directory, easily automatable via batch files or similar. Don't like the command line? Lots of free GUIs avaliable online.</p>
	<p><strong><a href="https://getwacup.com/" target="_parent">WACUP</a></strong><br>
	Party like it's 2002 with a modernized version of WinAmp!<br>
	Sounds great (equalizers!!!) and looks great doing it. And we all know having a skin of your favourite Touhou character is more important than any other feature in a music player anyway.<br>
	Also the only good desktop Windows internet radio program. Somehow. in 2025. ???</p>
	<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/i2van/hourglass" target="_parent">Hourglass</a></strong><br>
	Simple visual timer. Customizable colours and sounds and some really great input features (i.e. putting in a AM/PM time instead of an amount of time) make it a cut above.</p>
	<p><strong><a href="https://www.zhornsoftware.co.uk/stickies/" target="_parent">Stickies</a></strong><br>
	Really great sticky notes! Can be used as a timer/reminders system also.</p>
	<p><strong><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/install" target="parent">Microsoft Powertoys</a></strong><br>
	Do silly things on Windows faster and with more efficiency. I like the power-renamer tool and color-picker the best.</p>
	<h3 id="art">Art</h3>
	<p><strong><a href="https://line-of-action.com/practice-tools/app#/" target="_parent">Line of Action</a></strong><br>
	The OG figure-drawing practice website, with a big bank of nude and clothed models (and hand, expression, animal and background photos) to draw. Has a paid option but most of it is free.</p>
	<p><strong><a href="https://www.sketchdaily.net/" target="_parent">SketchDaily</a></strong><br>
	More of the above, all for free. Also has a 'vegetation' section that may be useful for practicing scenery and backgrounds, and the option to use your own images in the same timed format.</p>
	<p><strong><a href="https://www.vishopper.com/cut-out-people" target="_parent">Cut-Out People</a></strong><br>
	Technically this is a stock-photo website but its detailed sorting options make it great for clothed reference pictures.</p>
	<p><strong><a href="https://www.ctrlpaint.com/">Ctrl+Paint</a></strong><br>
	Beginner-through-intermediate art tutorial/lesson videos, geared torwards digital painting but mostly generally applicable standard stuff. <a href="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/0a/50/54/0a50548ce17cf81f34928ceb7dec7cb5.jpg" target="_parent">Why Pay More?</a></p>
	<p><strong><a href="https://colorhunt.co/" target="_parent">ColorHunt</a></strong><br>
	Color pallette site.</p>
	<p><strong><a href="https://wonderbooknow.com/" target="_parent">Wonderbook Web Extras</a></strong><br>
	This is a web-supplementary to the popular 'how-to-write-genre-fiction' book Wonderbook by successful science-fiction writer Jeff Vandermeer (who I don't like very much, but that's a different story.) However most of the excercises and advice here can be practiced without the book or any knowledge of it's contents and are great fun for beginner writers (like me!)</p>
	<h3 id="selfhost">Selfhosting</h3>
	<p>If you aren't selfhosting a bunch of semi-useless crap software and you have a PC… what are you even doing with your life???</p>
	<p><strong><a href="https://jellyfin.org/" target="_parent">Jellyfin</a></strong><br>
	Stream your own music and video off of your computer to any screen in the house!</p>
	<p><strong><a href="https://www.ethanmad.com/post/jellyfin_remote_access/" target="_parent">Jellyfin Remote Access with Tailscale (and Caddy)</a></strong><br>
	That sounds like a lot but actually this is an extremely simple guide to making Jellyfin accessible outside of your home wi-fi (and once you have it setup, you can use it to access other selfhosted programs too.)<br>
	Also see Headscale, WG-Easy for alternative at-home VPN systems.</p>
	<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/DIYgod/RSSHub" target="_parent">RSSHub</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://rss-bridge.org/" target="_parent">RSSBridge</a></strong><br>
	'Translates' various sources to RSS feeds for your reading pleasure.</p>
	<p><strong><a href="https://www.freshrss.org/" target="_parent">FreshRSS</a></strong><br>
...and this one 'aggregates' your feeds, so you only have to query things once to view them on all your devices (and your reading status stays in sync!) Set your auto-refresh to something super low (I have mine set to every 8 hours) and chill way the fuck out.</p>

	<div id="timewasters"><h2>TIMEWASTERS</h2>
	<h3 id="music">Music</h3>
	<p><strong><a href="https://www.radio.garden/listen/" target="_parent">Radio Garden</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://fmstream.org/index.php?c=FT" target="_parent">FMStream</a></strong><br>
	Internet radio indexes with tunes from all over.<br>
	Some stations I really like: CJSW, KEXP, DARE.FM, Tuff City Radio, Groovy Reflections, KPOA FM, anything Pinguin, JazzFM Romania...</p>
	<p><strong><a href="https://radio.kwsx.online/" target="_parent">KWSX Radio</a></strong><br>
Great web radio with no genre-specific focus (mostly electronic, but still awful broad) and lots of new unknown artists. Hosts live shows from people named things like 'DJ Financial Crisis' and 'Credit Card Skimmer'.</p>
	<p><strong><a href="https://gensokyoradio.net/" target="parent">Gensokyo Radio</a></strong><br>
	24/7 Touhou fan-music (rearrangements, covers, and original themed songs) station. Really wild how varied this stuff actually is. Some of it is even <em>good</em>.</p>
	<p><strong><a href="https://softtempolounge.com/" target="parent">Soft Tempo Lounge</a></strong><br>
	Midcentury lounge-music and graphics for your listening pleasure. Great to work to.</p>
	<p><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQb0TYGAmso" target="parent">catatonicyouths</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGTQBFOIlnk" target="parent">fantafox</a></strong><br>
OK linking a youtube channel is cheating, but... <br>
Channels compiling terrible original music from around the Internet and beyond. There is something truly fascinating and inspiring to me about these... just various kinds of regular people producing their terrible art and sharing it with the world... it's almost like a perfect cross section of humanity, every demographic and type of person you can imagine is represented in these. I've watched Weird Dude Energy probably 100 times now.<br>
(Check comments for links to nearly all of the full tracks, if you want them for.... some reason....)</p>
	<p><strong><a href="https://ambiph.one/" target="_parent">ambiphone</a></strong><br>
	Ambient/white noise machine (with some music options) for focus, sleep etc. Works as an offline PWA also. More sound options than any other free site, I think. Does anyone actually listen to printer noises to relax?</p>
	<p><strong><a href="https://www.metal-archives.com/" target="_parent">Encylopaedia Metallum</a></strong><br>
	Massive database of metal bands! Includes some of the only info on the internet about a lot of obscure local bands from bygone decades. If you're ever going through a relative or friend's old local music collections this can be your best friend. Or if you just like looking through hyperobscure bands.</p>
	<h3 id="read">Reading</h3>
	 <p><strong><a href="https://archive.org" target="_parent">The Internet Archive</a></strong><br>
	 Primarily an online library but also has video, software and other random crap. World's finest.</p>
	 <p><strong><a href="https://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/" target="_parent">Lightspeed</strong></a><br>
  An online science-fiction and fantasy magazine. Loads of stories by loads of authors, varying in quality, but all free!
  </p>
  <p><strong><a href="https://clarkesworldmagazine.com/" target="_parent">Clarkesworld</strong></a><br>
  Another online science-fiction magazine. Probably my favourite, especially their translations of Chinese stories.
  </p>
   <p><strong><a href="https://giganotosaurus.org/" target="_parent">Giganotosaurus</strong></a><br>
  And another. This one specializes in 'longish' amateur fiction that tends to be blocked from other amateur magazine submissions by it's length.
  </p>
  <p><strong><a href="https://www.juxtapoz.com/" target="_parent">Juxtapoz</a></strong><br>
  Well-known long-running contemporary art and design magazine.</p>
  <p><strong><a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/49303/howl" target="_parent">Poetry Foundation</a></strong><br>
  <em>(this link will take you to Howl by Allen Ginsberg.)</em><br>
  Read poetry for free! And lots of commentary, analysis etc.</p>
  <p><strong><a href="https://www.surlalunefairytales.com/" target="_parent">Sur La Lune</a></strong><br>
  Fairy tales! Full texts of various versions, collections, annotations, illustrations, a blog listing various new adaptations...</p>
   <p><strong><a href="https://www.meetnewbooks.com/" target="_parent">Meet New Books</strong></a><br>
  Curated book recommendations based on other books. No account needed; just put your favourite (book, genre, theme...) in and see what comes up.
  </p>
  <p><strong><a href="https://heyzine.com/flip-book/8f2739d498.html" target="_parent">Drawing for Nothing</a></strong><br>
	Zine compiling information and art related to various cancelled animated films. Wild Life really sounds like it would have been one of the greatest and least comprehensible pieces of feature-length animation ever made and I'm terribly sad it was canned.</p>
  <p><strong><a href="https://dawnoftimecomics.com/" target="_parent">Dawn of Time</strong></a><br>
  A mostly-wordless webcomic about a ditzy cavegirl, her triceratops friend, and a Victorian time-traveller. Only 300-ish pages long, but extremely charming.</p>
	<h3 id="game">Video and Board Games</h3>
	<p><strong><a href="https://glossary.infil.net/" target="_parent">The Fighting Game Glossary</a></strong><br>
	Ever wondered what 'meaty', 'okizeme', or 'setplay' means? Now you can finally know!!!<br>
	The only thing that made learning fighting games bearable for me as a beginner player. A link to this should come with every copy of every game currently sold, seriously.</p>
	<p><strong><a href="https://boardgamearena.com/" target="_parent">Board Game Arena</a></strong><br>
	Play various popular board games online with your friends!</p>
	<p><strong><a href="https://playscrabble.com/" target="_parent">Play Scrabble Online For Free</a></strong><br>
	I wish more websites had self-explanatory names like this.</p>
	<h3 id="tv">TV, Movies, and Video</h3>
		<p><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8o-gtpLf5A" target="_parent">Life After BOB</strong></a><br>
  50-minute short science fiction animated film, originally presented as a real-time interactive animation in art galleries alongside an in-universe wiki. A dense, surrealist look into a world where you can let an AI 'drone' your life for you, people subsist on 'protein silks', and entire universes can be created inside the brain of a tortoise. Weird! But cool!</p>
	<p><strong><a href="https://explore.org/livecams" target="_parent">explore.org</strong></a><br>
  A website and organization that features and funds a variety of wildlife, zoo and animal-rescue livestreams. Personal favourites of mine are the Ventana Wildlife Association's California Condor livestreams (a soap opera unto themselves), the Mississippi River bird livestream, and the various Orcalab livestreams of the Vancouver Island coast.</p>
	<p><strong><a href="https://homestarrunner.com/main" target="_parent">Homestar Runner</strong></a><br>
  Everybody loves the Homestar Runner! He is a terrific internet cartoon.</p></p>

	<h2>CURIOSITIES</h2>
	<p>This section is for links to pages that are not exactly useful but that don't really belong in 'Entertainment' either. Things like fanpages for obscure games, funny articles, very specific software, etc.</p>
	<p><strong><a href="https://www.helpfulsnowman.com/petes-exhaustive-review-of-modelland/" target="_parent">Pete's Exhaustive Review of Modelland</a></strong><br>
Quite possibly one of my favourite pages on the internet: a detailed runthrough of the young-adult science-fantasy dystopian novel(?) written(?) by Tyra Banks (the one part I can believe, because no ghostwriter could produce something this insane.) Genuinely indescribable, almost deranged levels of nonsensical writing, phrasing, worldbuilding, storytelling, and it's all modelling-themed (naturally.) Warning: reading may make you wish ANTM was still on the air.<br>
(This page is also avaliable as an E-book, if you want to support the author or read on an e-reader.)</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://applerankings.com/" target="_parent">AppleRankings.com</a></strong><br>
Reviews of every kind of common apple cultivar available in the United States, ranked on a scale from 'Criminal Malfeasance' to 'the Immaculate Apple'. Find a new favourite today!</p>
	<p><strong><a href="https://www.bobheffner.com/dinosaursattack/" target="_parent">Bob's Dinosaurs Attack! Homepage</strong></a><br>
  A fanpage for the 80s' Topps trading-card series Dinosaurs Attack!, which features over-the-top B-movie art of dinosaurs killing people.</p>
	 <p><strong><a href="https://www.ipdb.org/search.cgi" target="_parent">Internet Pinball Database</strong></a><br>
  A collaborative database of everything you could ever want to know about every pinball machine ever made. Includes photos of pins, production-history notes, flyers, designer credits, and loads more.</p>
  <p><strong><a href="https://www.mrbreakfast.com/cereal_home.asp" target="_parent">Mr. Breakfast's Cereal Project</strong></a><br>
  A website compiling information on American breakfast-cereals and their mascots, which was probably my oldest and most bizarre 'special interest' (yes, really--there's a lot of interesting history relating to legislation of marketing aimed torwards children tied up in them, and a lot of amazing design and animation.)</p>
  <p><strong><a href="https://asn.flightsafety.org/" target="_parent">Aviation Safety Network</a></strong><br>
	Plane crash database. Not for anxious people.</p>
	<p><strong><a href="https://www.faceball2000.com/" target="_parent">FaceBall 2000 GB: The Only Fansite</a></strong><br>
	Maybe the most bizarre video game thing <em>ever</em>--a 3D first-person shooter from 1991(!) for the original Game Boy(!!) that supported up to 16(!!!) players.</p>
	 <p><strong><a href="https://finfin.de" target="_parent">FinFin.de</strong></a><br>
  A super-colourful site with information on a 90s virtual-pet... game... simulation... thing called Fin Fin, in which you observe a bird-dolphin hybrid. Actually it's more of an 'alien birdwatching simulator' than anything else. Very fun.</p>
	<p><strong><a target="_parent" href="https://dustri.org/b/horrible-edge-cases-to-consider-when-dealing-with-music.html">Horrible Edge Cases to Consider when Dealing with Music</a></strong><br>
	Showcasing some truly bizarre 'artistic' choices as well as the general failure of computers to do things well.<br>
	If I had a buck for every time all my Weezer albums got mashed into one mega-album I would be a rich woman.</p>
	<p><strong><a target="_parent" href="https://phiresky.github.io/blog/2025/visualizing-all-books-in-isbn-space/">Visualizing all books of the world in ISBN space</a></strong><br>
	The sum total of human knowledge, as a cool interactive graph. I dare anyone to look at this and tell me they still think the 21st century is a bad time to be alive.</p> 
	<p><strong><a target="_parent" href="https://lpcoverlover.com/">LP Cover Lover</a></strong><br>
	Weird and wonderful album covers from yesteryear.</p>
