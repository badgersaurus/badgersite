   <h1>2025 ANNUAL STATE OF THE BADGER ADDRESS</h1>
    <p>Hoo wee it has been a while huh? I have been so busy with school I have just forgotten about the site!<BR>	
I also have done some silly things in terms of organization this year. But I also figured out some really important stuff about my brain so I don't think it's so bad I left the new years' page until... um it's the 28th. uh.<br>
This year's is basically the same structure as 2024's. I'll go over how 2025 was, what 2026 will hopefully be like, et cetera.</p>

<h2> 2025 IN REVIEW</h2>
<p>The first half of 2025 was like the first half of 2024: sucked. <br>
The second half has been BUSY!!!!! As evidenced by the next to no site updates, all my attention and energy has been focused on school and things around school. Then when I finally get some free time all I wanna do is veg out and play dumb video games and read books. But I'm happy! Chemistry is fascinating, physics was bearable, I passed the Calculus Course from Hell which demanded 100% perfect performance on all online quizzes and an obscene amount of homework and changes to the grading structure every 2 weeks, Stats was fun. I haven't made any real friends in uni yet but I have found what I hope are the right trees to bark up in terms of meeting likeminded people and am much more organized so hopefully that'll change in term 2. I'm very excited about volunteering for the school radio station in particular! </p>

<p>Aside from that things have been slow here. <br>
I've been journalling a lot and drawing a lot although none of it is something I can share. Nothing really bad happened. One of my favourite anime ever got a second season and it was just as good as the 15-year-old original. I visited Nashville and that was fun. I saw 3 concerts(!). I got to eat lots of good food. I didn't have to cut off any more IRL friends this year. Learning more about my religion and it's cool. I've gotten a lot better at self-organization with things. I have really nothing to complain about! So now what do I write??<br>
Canadian politicks and economicks? I'm trying not to stress about it and just let it be a motivation to do well in my studies so I can get the hell outta dodge ASAP. Family stuff? Not for the internet. The fact that I still have a little bit of perfume left from my last bottle and I've started to get sick of it and already bought my next one so it seems like I'll still be wearing this one for ages???<br>
I feel like this is so boring compared to last year's but hey I have way less time to stew in my own brain nowadays, of course it's gonna be less introspective. </p>

<p>Like I reeaally don't have anything else to write. Um.</p>
</div>
<div><h2>BADGERSAURUS IN 2026</h2>
	<p>I think I got a decent amount done in 2025 before The Incident and I'm hoping to get back to it now. I sorta forgot what it was like to write here. But I also don't feel guilty for ignoring it or anything and it might happen again. Sawry.<br>
This year's plans are a lot more limited and a lot more focused on things I think I'll enjoy doing than things I think I <em>should</em> do, which is sort of the thing I've been struggling with in all areas of my life... I'm trying to break that mindset and just be a hot girl having fun, as they say. (pancake party time link)<br>
So, here's what I'd LIKE to do:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Deprecate album wall:</strong> Last year one of my goals was to update the album wall. I did that... once. Keeping an actual digital music collection is work enough with tagging and so on... I feel like my last.fm (and if i ever want, selfhosted alternatives) serve that showing-off purpose fine.</li>
<li></strong>Magical girl page:</strong> I wanna actually do it this year!! I keep starting on this and throwing what I have done away. I have some solid plans now though so hopefully it goes OK. I think I'll have a lotta fun working on this once the groundwork is layed.</li>
<li><strong>A theme!</strong> Either a red or blueish one. I've always loved sites that let you customize them and am excited to make some brand new Badgersaurus graphics. </li>
<li><strong>Comic project:</strong> Eventually I want to have something here I can point torwards as a real finished project. This year I'll do something small to hopefully make that happen. Mostly I just wanna prove to myself that I can do it, regardless of the quality of the work. It probably won't be very good but who cares.</li>
<li><strong>Kaiju page:</strong> Another idiot box subpage I'd like to do. This'll be a collection of silly little webpagey things like a personality quiz, adpotables, etc. rather than a formal article/writeup like I usually do. Again I think it'll be a lot of fun to make.</li>
<li><strong>Shmups page:</strong> A catalog of my 1CCs !! After all why get them if you're not gonna show 'em off?? Small table-based page. It'll be cute.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2025 RESOLUTIONS IN REVIEW</h2>
<p><strong>Work Out Every Day</strong><br> I definitely excercised more but not all the time like I wanted to. I have access to a gym now though so I'll try and get out there this year.</p>
<p><strong>More Meaningful Artistic Output</strong><br> Sorta! I've been pumping away in a little notebook at D-ROID stuff here and there. I'll probably be able to actually draw it this year with a much clearer idea of a storyline and such. Will it be good? No, but I'll have fun making it, and that's what matters.</p>
<p><strong>Learn to Cook Real Good</strong><br> I did not do this even a little bit. It's real hard when it's your mom's only hobby and it's mostly just you and her 9/10ths of the year...</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>2026 RESOLUTIONS</h2>
<p><strong>Bullet journal</strong><br>
 I bought a cheap-o notebook and I'm gonna try keeping my to-dos and such in paper. I've been doing interstitial journalling lately which is really very helpful to me, especially as I do a lot of little tasks that just take a couple minutes and then can lose sight of what I really want to spend my time on as a result. Transition time and all that. I can do it fine in a .txt file in notepad++ or what have you... when I'm at my PC. I've also got a little pocket notebook to use when I'm out and about. So far it's been going well.</p>

<p><strong>Makeup</strong><br>
 I always feel like a clownish 12-year-old when I try putting on any makeup that isn't simple lipgloss or eyeshadow and I wanna fix that! Got some old books and internet guides to work with and lots of nice things to use. Just lots of little practice here and there I suppose.</p> 
</div>
<div>
<h2>GAME BINGO PAGE</h2>
<p>And to make up for the shortish and late page this year, please enjoy <a href="gamebingo.html">this small new page</a> I worked on! It's a fun 'book bingo' style gimmick for video games. Maybe play (literally) along at home?<br>
if you missed it on the main page, I also added some new links to Surfin'; more coming soon!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>THANK YOU</h2>
<p>And once again I'd like to thank everyone who visited this site in 2025. I was kind of on some doomer shit this time last year but not anymore babey. Keep your heads up! It gets better!</p>

<p>See you soonish,<br>
- Piper</p>
