 <h1>Piper's Self-Indulgent Urusei Yatsura Page</h1>
 <p><em>(Or, PSIUYP, for short)</em></p>
 <p>Urusei Yatsura is one of them rom-com mangas by Rumiko Takahashi and I have become unreasonably attached to it during my senior year of high-school because I guess that's just the point my life is at now.<br>
 Maybe this will be a proper shrine or analysis page someday but for now it's just a collection of, like, you remember those 2018 Tumblr pages that just did 'incorrect quotes' for whatever shitty fandom bullshit they wanted? It's that. Yeah.</p>
 <p>I'll spiff this up later but I got finals to study for now. I wanted to squeeze this out before the remake (amd my own high-school years) ended as a sorta celebratory thing.</p>
