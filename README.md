Mirror of neocities badgersaurus.neocities.org which is also my web site.

Mostly handcoded + use 11ty to statically generate things. This repo is only the output folder/'wild' state, the input/'domestic' stays on my PC. Original graphics done in Affinity + CSP, lotsa stuff grabbed from around the web and media landscape.
