    <h1>UPDATE ARCHIVE</h1>
	<p>Badgersaurus has been around since March 15, 2022, and as you can imagine the update-log on the homepage was getting quite long. So one day I moved it all here.<br>
	Now you can browse Badgersaurus' past updates with relative ease! Kind-of.</p>
	<p>Stuff gets moved from the main page update-log to here... whenever I remember to cut it down. You do know I play all this website stuff by ear, right?</p>
