   <h1>STARTPAGES</h1>
    <h2>METRO STARTPAGE</h2>
	<img src="images/startpageexample.png" width="500px">
	<p>This is a simple static browser startpage made using HTML5, CSS, and very basic, messy Javascript. It was my first time using the latter, so it's probably not very good, but it runs quick locally at least.</p>
	<p>Features include:</p>
	<div class="normallist"><ul>
	<li>As many 'paginated' groups of bookmarks as you want via the buttons at the bottom (2 buttons included, but making a third should be very easy with any vector software)</li>
	<li>CSS variables for easy color customization, at the start of the CSS file</li>
	<li>Setup for both solid-color and image/gif banner backgrounds (or both, as in the demo)</li>
	<li>Link hover color-change</li>
	<li>A basic DuckDuckGo searchbar</li>
	<li>Super-cool, modern, neon-drenched design (this is not subjective)</li>
	</ul></div>

	<p>To customize:</p>
<div class="normallist"><ul><li>Open the 'script.js' file and fill each 'Box' variable with your preferred bookmarks and h2 header. Ensure that a br is stuck between the header, the first link, and each link afterwards. Be careful of quotation marks in links, because Javascript is a bitch about them for some reason.</li>
<li>Open the .css file and change the color variables and background .gif variable around.</li>
<li>Other tips: You can use more variables in the script file to change the banner gif or colors 'per-page' by button. You can also add more buttons by tweaking the code in the script and HTML files--ensure that all the IDs are set up correctly. You can use a background image for the searchbar if you want an icon.</li></ul></div>
	<p>More startpages coming soon... someday... maybe!</p>
