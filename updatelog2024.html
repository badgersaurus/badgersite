<h1>UPDATES<br>JULY 2024-NOW</h1>
<h2>BADGERSAURUS<br>'A QUICK ONE WHILE HE'S AWAY' EDITION</h2>
<p><strong>11/01/2026</strong><br>
Oh man it's a little late but the 2025 New Year's page is up in Extras, so is a new page in the Arcade and some links. I sort of did nothing all winter break except play video games (read: Disgaea 2) and eat junk food but I think I deserve it. I passed all my first term classes!!<br>
School starts again tomorrow. I'll try to be more active on here but no promises.</p>
<h2>BADGERSAURUS<br>'MILO GOES TO COLLEGE (AGAIN)' EDITION</h2>
<p><strong>6/09/2025</strong><br>
I'm officially a university student now! Hooray. Appropriate adjustments made to my About page and a new entry in the concert journal. Check it out!</p>
<p>Hello to any new friends or acquaintances who I've directed here!! This is my website. I work pretty hard on it. Some of these pages go back to when I was 15. I try to update every week or two (but we'll see how things go with being busy with a science degree!) Please poke around it and let me know what you think. :)</p>
<p>I read a Pynchon novel the other day and didn't like it. Got a nail fill. Figured some stuff out about myself productivity wise so that's good. Just in time!!<br>
I'm wrapping up a replay of No Straight Roads at time of writing and aside from it still being one of my all-time favourite video games I gotta say bold artistic choice to have one main character be a fully realized, interesting, flawed human being with a backstory and interesting character traits and to have the other one be just completely fucking insane cartoon bullshit. Zuke gets two whole ass entire long sections of the game dedicated to his deal and Mayday's entire personality is just 'likes the Clash' and 'has no respect for other human beings or their property on a basic fundamental level.' Realest bitch in video games.<br>
That's about it other than school. See yall soonish.</p>
<h2>BADGERSAURUS<br>'OCEAN SIZE' EDITION</h2>
<p><strong>17/08/2025</strong><br>
I have created a Docker tutorial for beginners in self-hosting on Windows which you can now read in the Extras section! If you have ever been curious about selfhosting go and check it out.</p>
<p>Well the weather's nice again. Drawing a lot but nothing presentable. I bought an E-reader (basic BW Kobo model) a while back and have been really lovin' it, so nice to just kick back in bed with a new book without having to worry about library hold times or finding a place for it on my shelf or foisting it off on some sucker. I really enjoyed Milk Sulphate and Alby Starvation and would recommend it to anyone. On the Road was OK. Now I'm reading The Diamond Age and it's really good. Also a whole shwack of comics. Need to make a books-n-comix section on here soon...<br>
I got gel nails, those are fun. Just a pale pink for now, maybe I'll try white or red in the future. Playing a lot of No Man's Sky and considering making a page here with postcards from the planets I've seen. Such a seriously lovely game. Just feels so open! Right now I'm splitting my time between building an alien ranch and fossil-hunting.<br>
Also been looking at cars. I don't know anything about cars except how to drive one. Hopefully I will have my own soon.</p>
<p>Sorry if I seem like I've kinda dropped off the grid, just re-prioritizing stuff ahead of school here. Sooooo excited!!! YAY CHEMISTRY!!!!! Updates will be slow again like in past years, but that's OK.</p>
<h2>BADGERSAURUS<br>&quot;GAMMA RAY&quot; EDITION</h2>
<p><strong>22/07/2025</strong><br>
The Closet index works now. It does not link to anything, but it no longer throws you to the Ghost World screencap, at least. This is the second-last of my reel serious goals for 2025 development of the site. The last last one is probably going to take a long while. I keep putting it off and it really is a big undertaking.<br>
The good news is once it's done I feel like I'm on easy street with the site, just low-code fun stuff and pages I can update over time as psuedo-blogs, no real big plans. The Kaiju page will be I guess, but it's gonna be more of a javascript playground than anything else. I'm really glad for this because work here will definitely slow down once I start uni and I want it to all be really fun and frictionless to work on. Also I NEED to do some webcomic work like holy shit. They ain't writing themselves that's for sure.<br>
Also a couple more drawings are up, probably the last for this Gallery page before I start a new one.</p>
<p>We've got west-coast weather here which is shitty!! So sick of this nonstop rain. Other than that everything is A-OK.<br>
My next update may or may not be a Docker-on-Windows tutorial since I have some buddies who want to get into self-hosting but there are no good written guides to send them. Keep an eye out.</p>
<h2>BADGERSAURUS<br>&quot;ADD IT UP&quot; EDITION</h2>
<p><strong>16/07/2025</strong><br>
Today I look around Neocities and everyone I follow is making big nice updates with all sorts of complex writing, art etc. Well today I have nothing for you but a barely qualifying Concert Journal update, some stupid fanart for a stupid show, and a little adjustment to the About page since my birthday was some time ago.<br>
That is all. Sorry. Magical girl page coming Soon(tm). Doing some construction drawing shit in the meantime to gear up for that.</p>
<p>Also I did some coding help for somebody else recently and that was fun. I watched American Movie, that was interesting. I like documentaries like that, just a peek inside some slightly unusual person's world for a little while. It made me want to make stuff, even as miserable as the process can become.</p>
<h2>BADGERSAURUS<br>&quot;BABY DARLING DOLLFACE HONEY&quot; EDITION</h2>
<p><strong>20/06/2025</strong><br>
I'm back! Actually I came back this day last week but I've been lazy. Slothful even.<br>
The concert journal has been updated! Nashville was awesome. At the Country Music Hall of Fame I saw Gram Parsons' nudie suit and Elvis' insane evil Cadillac (complete with TV set, telephone, record player and mini-fridge) among other cool shit. Did you know they have a 'Taylor Swift Education Center' now? I ate really good barbecue and almost bought several things from neat little boutique stores but then didn't buy anything except a print from the Hatch Show gift shop (because duh.) Really fun place to go for a weekend or so.</p>
<p>Nothing else interesting going on except that <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3758980/NO_STRAIGHT_ROADS_2/">A SECOND NO STRAIGHT ROADS HAS HIT THE TOWERS WHAT</a> also a new Double Fine game??? Am I in middle school again??? I hope not that shit was miserable. Games look sick though.<br>
See y'all soon.</p>
<h2>BADGERSAURUS<br>&quot;YOUR NEW CUCKOO&quot; EDITION</h2>
<p><strong>6/06/2025</strong><br>
The Album Wall has been updated.<br>
I love how that page looks but working on it is so fucking tedious. I kinda wanna see if I can write a simple script to simplify it a little bit. It's not anywhere near done but I got sick of working on it. Also stuck some new sketches up in the Gallery. I've been drawing lots lately but haven't felt any of it was good enough to share. About halfway through my sketchbook I started this year... right on schedule.<br>
I also stuck the site button back on the Surfin' page after leaving it off by accident.<br>
And there's now a widget linking to my lastFM account on the Radio page.</p>
<p>Next is the magical girl page. I have a clear idea of what I want to do for it now so that's good. It's gonna be very involved work but very fun. I was wanting to have it done by the June premiere of a certain underground-comix-inspired, brightly-colored, hyperstylized comically-sexual genre-takeoff anime getting a second season soon... and I have to specify it's NOT the one called Dandadan, why are there two of these??? (Not that I'm complaining.)<br>
Anyway that's not happening, it's probably gonna take me a month or two. I still wanna do some fanart of those two though. Banger TV shows.</p>
<p>Also been reading a lot lately. Just some classic literature and business-scandal nonfiction, nothing especially worth noting. I did reread Geek Love like three times and it's still one of my favourite novels (and still makes me want to throw up a little bit.) And the comic Nowhere Men which is... eh. I'm starting to think modern American comics are like socialism; great in theory but in practice... Such a great concept (mod-ish retrofuturistic world where mad scientists have become the new celebrity class) and it's squandered on 'the ragtag bunch of mutants must escape their predicament!!' like so many bad X-men series. Meh.</p>
<p>Nothing else going on in my world except that I'll be going to Nashville in a few days!! Boy am I excited. It's to see a concert. Sadly not a country one but, you know.<br>
This edition named for the Cardigans song. Love that album lately.</p>
<h2>BADGERSAURUS<br>&quot;MAGIC CHRISTIAN MUSIC&quot; EDITION</h2>
<p><strong>13/05/2025</strong><br>
The Neo-Neighbours section is up now. I have dropped people who were inactive, hosted evil weirdo shit on their sites, or who seem especially young and/or emotionally immature (the less attention they get at this point the better, not in a smarmy way but a safety one.) I've also omitted a few I'd like to link to from friends and such that just aren't done yet. May have missed some people also so I guess watch the space.<br>
I've also added another link to the Curiosities section courtesy of my mum. She says she had a great collection of bookmarks on her old hard drive, which I can't currently access but hopefully will be able to look through soon.</p>
<p>Not much else to report on here. I mean lots has been happening but talking about it on here feels a bit... eh. Uhh, I've been having a lot of fun looking through the Digimon wiki. Apparently Digimon aren't really subject to any prevailing design rules so they can be cute puppy dogs or pin-up girls or Literally Just A Plane as well as the expected cool dragons and warrior guys and stuff. Very fun. There's even a <a href="https://wikimon.net/Lovely_Angemon">magical girl one.</a><br>
Also been reading a book about the Enron scandal. Actually insane shit. These people were making 700 grand a year (plus bonuses) to basically lose money on dumb projects that didn't work and then pretend they didn't have to pay any debt back ever. Dream job lowkey.</p>
<p>This week named for the album by Badfinger, pretty good sound-alikes of the Beatles. I like it.</p>
<h2>BADGERSAURUS<br>&quot;COAL MINER'S DAUGHTER&quot; EDITION</h2>
<p><strong>1/05/2025</strong><br>
The Surfin' page has been redone! The Neo-Neighbours section is still missing because I absolutely have not had any kind of motivation to work on it and I got sick of waiting to put the rest up. I'll do it in the next week or two.<br>
I have also put some art up in the Gallery that I've been sitting on. And a few housekeeping-type updates.</p>
<p>Next projects are the Album Wall (tedious) and the magical girl page (my usual over-ambitious cartoon garbage.) I guess I should squeeze out the Closet index sometime soon too. I've been busy the last few weeks re-doing my digital and IRL organization systems and going thru a major mindset change in general. Also running some selfhosted services which is fun. Things are good here. Except for Canadian politics. Another 4 years of economic decline and barely-functional government!!! Yippy!!<br>
I'll also take this spot and say there probably won't be any more updates to the Playlists because I am now one of those people who collects music locally and is hugely annoying about it.<br>
Maybe I'll make .m3u versions that assume a Music/Artist/Album/Song organization ? Could be a fun few afternoons.</p>
<p>This week titled of course for the Loretta Lynn song and biopic. The reason I started collecting music locally again is because of that fuckin Jack White-produced album (Van Lear Rose) she did that's not avaliable anywhere anymore. It's like the best thing ever recorded.</p>
<h2>BADGERSAURUS<br>&quot;NEEDLES AND PINS&quot; EDITION</h2>
<p><strong>6/04/2025</strong></p>
<p>'Tyger, tyger, burning bright/In the forests of the night/What immortal hand or eye/Could frame thy fearful symmetry?'... This one could, apparently, because the Urusei Yatsura page is finally done. Just in time for Ataru's birthday too!<br>
The reason it took ages was because 1) it is a very long page that required sourcing things from an excruciatingly long (sorts into 17-double-length manga volumes in the most recent release) comic with very little English fan resources and 2) I kept writing about a third of it, growing dissatisfied with it, and then starting over. And over. And over again. And then I kept putting off the final 'fittings' to put the damn thing on-line.<br>
Truthfully I'm still not fully satisfied with the final product, but it's whatever now. If you visit it you'll find an entirely too detailed breakdown of all the things I like about the comic and some other fun little things. It can be found in the Idiot Box section, which now works!</p>
<p>One button enters and another button leaves... in other words the Surfin' page has been cut for now. I am in the process of retooling it into something a little more like classical curated links pages, which are rapidly becoming useful again in a post-AI-slop world. My poor little uBlacklist installation can only do so much to make search engines useable again... Luckily I have an extensive bookmark collection that you'll all get to see soon!<br>
The reason it's been cut is, truthfully, it has fallen into a state of possibly harmful disrepair. I say harmful because a surf of the 'other personal sites' section leads me to several people who once seemed cool but have now either stopped updating their site or who have become violently radicalized and now openly support things like terrorist hate groups on their pages (a risk you always take when befriending counterculture or 'counterculture' types, unfortunately.)<br>
So I took the page out back and shot it but it's reanimated corpse will shamble these halls once again, Frankenweenie-style. Does anyone else remember that movie? I feel like I'm going insane whenever I talk about it and nobody knows what it is. I still have a plushie of the poodle character somewhere. I've started on the Album Wall page update as well. I have around 170(!!!) albums I'd like to list so it might be a while until you see it, but I'm ticking away at it in the background.</p>
<p>In other news: I got accepted into my first-choice university for next year!!! Taking Chemistry. I feel like I can finally lighten up again about everything now that I know what's goin' on.<br>
Been playing Chrono Trigger and Monkey Island. Good shit all around. I finished the Sopranos some time ago and have been inconsolable ever since. CHRISTOPHUHHH LOOK HOW BAD YOU FUCKED UP. WE'S ON A RANDOM TEENAGE GIRL'S WEBSITE, CHRISTOPHUH. 'AY I'M SORRY T I JUST WANTED TO LEARN SOME BASIC CEE ESS ESS'<br>
god why did they never do a spinoff or a sequel or anything FUCK</p>
<p>This week named for my favourite Ramones song as of late. See you guys very soon with art and stuff in tow!!</p>
<h2>BADGERSAURUS<br>&quot;YOU GONNA HAFTA SERVE SOMEBODY&quot; EDITION</h2>
<p><strong>20/01/2025</strong><br>
Happy New Years and what a busy busy time to be alive! If I wanted to cover all the big events in the last few weeks I have witty comments floating around in my head about I'd be here for hours. But this is a personal page and not a political blog or anything silly like that, so I will refrain from talking about it on here. You're all smart people, you read the news, you don't need me to regurgitate it for you.<br>
Speaking of news-- Badgersaurus now supports RSS, aka the one good thing 'power user' techbros ever did for the world. If you're not familiar, it's a simple protocol for notifying of website updates and news and blog posts via simple text readable by any number of popular softwares and extensions (I use a firefox one called Feedbro.) It's a simple and easy way to keep up with updates to sites like this one without having to check them all the time. Subscribe with the radar button in the right 'cocktail bar' using whatever reader you like best! I know this wasn't on my big new year's list but I've wanted to do it for a while, for convenience's sake.</p>
<p>And for real content:<br>
In the 'Extras' section, there is a custom browser startpage I made available for download! It's very cool I think. I know about JS and CSS variables now, which makes me even more powerful.<br>
There are some new playlists on the appropriate page.<br>
I went ahead and pushed some simple housekeeping and typo-fixing across the rest of the site, too. More stuff coming soon, as per usual.</p>
<p>This edition named for my favourite Bob Dylan song, Gotta Serve Somebody. I'm not a huge Dylan fan because I think his voice is weird, but God can he write... I'm a sucker for anyone else covering him. Kinda curious about that biopic with Chalamet that just came out, looks alright but I haven't read any reviews for it or asked anyone I know what they thought.</p>
<h2>BADGERSAURUS<br>&quot;FAIRYTALE OF NEW YORK&quot; EDITION</h2>
<p><strong>25/12/2024</strong><br>
Merry Christmas and Happy (C)Hanukkah as it may be. It's a weirdly warm one this year for us. I have just finished this year's slightly dour <a href="2024stateofthebadger.html">State of the Badger Address</a> and invite you to have a look at it! It's got all kindsa stuff up in there this year.<br>
It always feels weird to do the last update of the year. I'll be back in January soonish!</p>
<p>This edition title from the marvelous Christmas duet by the Pogues with Kirsty Maccoll. Makes me feel something every time.<br>
That asshat Hozier covered it this year and it sucked. I don't like him. I think he should stop making music forever. If this song becomes some kind of tiktok trend because of him I will be So Mad.</p>
<h2>BADGERSAURUS<br>&quot;IT'S PRONOUNCED WHY-TWO-KAY&quot; EDITION</h2>
<p><strong>17/12/2024</strong><br>
Just a little fanart drawing today. Nothing fancy. New year's column is almost done, just got a couple more things to string together. See you on Christmas, maybe?</p>
<p>Top ten Canadian politics moments: finance minister resigning hours before she was about to tell the country we're at a 62 billion dollar deficit at a cool number 4 or so, just behind <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjdTi1r-yRQ">Rob Ford personally taking crack off the streets</a></p>
<h2>BADGERSAURUS<br>&quot;TOO TOUGH TO DIE&quot; EDITION</h2>
<p><strong>5/12/2024</strong><br>
Been a really rough month-and-a-bit.<br>
Like, so so many unlucky things have happened to me and our family here and it would sound almost like a joke if I listed them off here. So that's why I've been quiet. But what can you do? I'll get through it. Just keep takin' the tablets.<br>
I'll be putting out my usual new years' thing, a housekeeping update, and then get back to really updating this sucker on-time in the new year. For now: three things in the Gallery. Enjoy.</p>
<p>This edition's name is from a late-period Ramones album. It's not one of their better ones but I like the name. I was very tempted to pick some Touhou song because I've been getting into that lately but I <em>am</em> trying to preserve my reputation a little bit here.</p>
<h2>BADGERSAURUS<br>&quot;VS. THE WORLD&quot; EDITION</h2>
<p><strong>10/09/2024</strong><br>
Good afternoon Neocities ! Today is a new birdwatching log from Saturday, a not particularly interesting video-game review, and uh that's it I guess. I need to get to work on the more interesting stuff here ASAP, it has been a while. I'm having a good couple weeks. Things are OK around here. I had a really good idea come to me from a dream like good ideas always do. Watch this space for D-ROID(?) and her many adventures, maybe coming to a website near you someday at some unforeseen point in the future. Yeah...</p>
<h2>BADGERSAURUS<br>&quot;BIG LIZARD IN MY BACKYARD&quot; EDITION</h2>
<p><strong>23/09/2024</strong><br>
Not too much goin on... I drew a new thing that's in the gallery. It's nothing spectacular. I was hoping to share the Ex Libris page I made for my new sketchbook but it looks like shit honestly so I'm not gonna share it here and you can't make me.<br>
Aside from that I've just been busy with stuff I can't really write about here: learning to drive and to cook and playing Jurassic Park Operation Genesis and trying to get someone to give me a job. I need to get some kinda new page out soon but I dunno what. Maybe a vinyl toy page? Feeling a bit uncreative for the last little bit.</p>
<p>Title today referencing the Dead Milkmen, one of only two things relating to Philadelphia that are worth knowing about (the other being <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDhaCdvRR_w&amp;t=320s">these fuckers</a> of course)</p>
<h2>BADGERSAURUS<br>&quot;TOO MUCH TOO YOUNG&quot; EDITION</h2>
<p><strong>9/09/2024</strong><br>
So I kinda fucked up with this one.<br>
Think it was just too much change too fast for my autistic ass but I’m back in 'Berta for now. Gonna get a job and alla that shit and then apply to some schools here. After about three days straight of doing nothing but crying and reading, finding myself unable to eat, and becoming so severely dehydrated my piss had turned orange I had to throw in the towel. Dedicated readers will note that I even missed Todayborday is a-Labor Day, so that will give you an idea of how bad shit was getting. I talk a big game sometimes but the truth is I’m a sensitive little bitch who can’t stand being woken up at one in the morning by loud assholes. I'm feeling much better now at least.<br>
Anyway--bad news for me is good news fer you guys 'cuz I get to dedicate some time to art as part of my Rn’R in the meantime. I have a bunch of sketches and ideas and shit and yes the page I keep saying I'm working on will get itself finished I promise. See you again VERY SOON!</p>
<p>Title this time is of the Specials' song about contraception and spending your 20s at home raising a kid instead of partying and accomplishing nothing with your miserable British life like a true rudeboy should. God I love that band.</p>
<h2>BADGERSAURUS<br>&quot;MILO GOES TO COLLEGE&quot; EDITION</h2>
<p>--</p>
<p><strong>25/08/24</strong><br>
Today: a new drawing in the Gallery that looks pretty damn good if I may say so myself.<br>
Another slow week--but the last one for a while because I'm leaving for uni this Wednesday or so. So no update next week and we'll see if I can squeeze anything in by the one after. UY page is like half done by my reckoning. I'll be able to update fine from school, just probably slower because I'll be oh-so-busy.<br>
I'm so excited but so nervous! I'm excited to meet new people and learn more about science and other things that interest me (I'm taking a business class as a side-thing, not a full minor but just to see) and join clubs and get to know my family out there better and enjoy B.C. as much as I can. I'm trying to focus on the positives like you're supposed to.<br>
And if you're somebody I just met at uni--hello! Glad you made it here! Some of the side buttons don't work but everything else should lead to cool shit I've made or written about. Enjoy!</p>
<p>This week's title is referencing the Descendents album, o'course. Aw man, my headphones died just as I was typing that...</p>
<h2>BADGERSAURUS<br>&quot;LOFI HIPHOP CHILL BEATS TO RELAX/DESTROY CITIES TO&quot; EDITION</h2>
<p><strong>11/08/2024</strong><br>
Today's update is just a spiffing-up of the new sidebar buttons and fixing the links in the Surfin' page to redirect properly. Nothing major but it was bugging me. I live and die by high-polish design and I really want Badgersaurus to reflect that. Honestly, I might still make some adjustments... I say that but no I won't cuz it ain't fun and I got BIOLOGY coming up. My ass is getting sent to the Science Mines for 4 years. (And hopefully more after that!)<br>
I'm so excited but so nervous... last night the whole 'living alone' thing hit me for the first time. I guess it won't be so bad though because everyone else will be in the same boat, and I do have family out there... I did add two extra links to the Surfin' page as well, just because. I'll add more neighbour links soon!</p>
<p>I've mostly just been shopping for crap for my dorm recently. So much stuff to buy... whatta pain. I finished a minor art project I can't share on here for personal reasons. The weather has been very changeable. The construction on the house across the street has been unbearably loud. I've been beset by even more webpage ideas but I'm sticking to my plans for now. Next Sunday, same time, same website...</p>
<h2>BADGERSAURUS<br>&quot;REBEL YELL&quot; EDITION</h2>
<p><strong>3/08/2024</strong><br>
Guess who saw a concert last night!! You can probably guess who by that title. Hit the Radio for more. That's all fer now.<br>
More soon. Like I said--general combthrough, idiot box, Urusei Yatsura writeup that i have about 80 ideas for. God I have a lot to say about that fucking alien cartoon. Me and alien cartoons, huh? It's like a shtick at this point.<br>
So see ya sometime next week.</p>
<h2>BADGERSAURUS<br>&quot;SPIRIT IN THE SKY&quot; EDITION</h2>
<p><strong>2/08/2024</strong><br>
It's a lovely sunny August day and I spent yesterday morning birdwatching! Go hit up the Aviary.<br>
I have some assorted things I want to spit-n-shine around the site but I'll be updating again tomorrow.... keep an eye out!</p>
<p>I finished Dragon Pilot and it is now cemented in my mind as one of my favourite pieces of TV ever. It is so fun and fresh and stylish and it draws on some really cool classical dragon-folklore ideas in it's back third that elevates it from 'cute mahou-shoujo-influenced show about self-improvement and self-love' into 'maybe the best take on classical western dragons in modern media since Tolkein.' I won't spoil it but the way it manages to have it's cake and eat it too with the dragons serving two very different narrative roles at the same time through the same behaviours is absolutely unique and I adore it. Or is it, really? They are 'winged serpents', after all. The dualism is perhaps the main appeal of the dragon as a figure in any story... and that's a new page concept for me. Ugh. Will my elaborate media-analysis ideas never cease??</p>
<p>The titles of these updates will draw on random media and music I've been enjoying. Today's is the one-hit-wonder Norman Greenbaum's take on gospel. It's good.</p>
<h2>BADGERSAURUS 2.0:<br>&quot;NEW REMASTERED SUPER-DELUXE&quot; EDITION</h2>
<p><strong>23/07/2024</strong></p>
<p>So it's finally here. The fabled Badgersaurus 2.0 update. Jesus Christ this took me ages.<br>
The big changes: you're looking at 'em! The site runs on I-frame power now. I drew up new graphics for everything and rewrote the main page layout to cut out useless code and make it easier to change things around. There's a theme switcher with only one theme for now. There're three new buttons on the left sidebar, for the first time in Badgersaurus history--the first two don't lead to anything now, but will shortly lead to pages on TV and movies and fashion and makeup, respectively. The 'Extras' button leads to my New Years pages and the update log. Updates are now in a new, flashier format, to suit my using them as a blog-esque section on everything happening to me. The 404 page has been switched again. I'll probably replace it with an original graphic soon. The Gallery is now paginated, so it'll load quicker, and so are the Birding Journal and Update Log (still linked below by the way.) The About page has been totally rewritten, but isn't totally done yet--I have to draw a couple self-portraits first! The site FINALLY has a favicon--no clue why I never got around to that. Badgersaurus Comix has been temporarily removed because I think the javascript will be a pain in the ass to move and anyway I haven't drawn any in ages. It WILL return... probably.<br>
Where have I been?<br>
Nowhere really. At home watching TV or reading or whatever. I haven't gotten out much this summer.<br>
I went paddleboarding the other day but didn't have a great time. American politics have gotten fucking insane, like more than usual. <a href="https://isitjoever.com/">It has never been more Joever than it is right now.</a><br>
Uhh, what else. Dragon Pilot is a very cute show (I got about a third left) and also if anyone sees the Masotan nendoroid for sale at a reasonable price anywhere please let me know. I need him. They announced a Magic Knight Rayearth remake right before I was about to start watching it which is kinda crazy. This has happened like 4 or 5 times now with random shit I like. Starting to become convinced I can manifest TV show remakes and TV show remakes only.<br>
Next update'll be a comb through the Surfin' page and an index for the Idiot Box so I can move the UY shrine to a permanent home and then finish it.<br>
See ya soonish!</p>
