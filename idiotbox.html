    <h1>IDIOT BOX</h1>
	<p>Like most people in our Western society, I watch entirely too much TV. Very often it is my main form of entertainment. I'm living proof that it doesn't rot your brain.<br>
In TV I tend to be drawn towards cerebral science-fiction, organized crime dramas, cooking reality shows (especially the various world Bake-Offs), various lowkey sitcoms, nature and business docuseries, magical girl anime, and various popular HBO things from yesteryear. In movies I'm drawn to all the classic B-movie genres (especially kaiju!), unusual coming-of-age stories, mob movies, and absolutely anything produced in the 60s or early 70s.</p>

<p>On this page, you can find some reviews of shows and movies I find particularly interesting, an interactive page with reviews of all the magical girl anime I've watched, and fanpages for Urusei Yatsura and for that finest artistic achievement in film, the giant monster movie.</p>
