<h1>WELCOME!</h1>
<p><em>One-half furry woodland critter! One-half prehistoric reptilian horror! One-hundred-percent punk-rock!</em></p>
<p>Welcome to <strong>BADGERSAURUS,</strong> the best damn website on the Internet, according to webmaster Piper K., best known for creating Badgersaurus.<br>
In other words... this is my corner of the Web, which I've been kicking around in some form or another since December 2021 and which has been up since March 2022, with updates every Sunday (more-or-less). Initially motivated by a hatred for social media corporations, a detest for bland minimalist design, and needing a place to host a gag comic strip I never really worked on, Badgersaurus has since expanded to cover a wide range of interests and perpetually-unfinished art projects.<br>
In other other words--this is my digital big-city-bachelorette-pad full of cool shit that I like and jabs at lame shit that I don't like. It's got rough edges and bright colours and a serious attitude problem, the kinda stuff you won't find on any bland old social media page. Not to mention a kaiju mascot!</p>
<p>So--since you're made it this far--why not have a look around? The buttons on the left will guide you throughout my different 'rooms', or if you'd prefer, you can check the bulletin-slash-diary below to see what's new...</p>

<h2>BADGERSAURUS<br>&quot;THE LITTLE GIRL FROM STRANGER THINGS OR WHATEVER&quot; EDITION</h2>
<p><strong>16/02/2026</strong><br>
Badgersaurus is now more powerful... eleven times more powerful in fact! These inner Iframe pages are now statically generated with 11ty, which makes writing and publishing about 11 times easier. I already write everything with markdown drafts, so this is just eliminating the annoying middle steps of copy-pasting and reformatting for HTML. Over the summer I'm hoping to do away with iframes entirely but we'll see.</p>
<p>Aside from that not much to report. A little update to the games bingo (verrry much considering breaking my own rules to buy Mewgenics, esp. considering I've been waiting for it for 8+ years...), little About adjustments, mostly I'm just excited about the site being soooo much easier to handle behind the scenes. Busy busy busy here at university. Hopefully this'll help me push more writing faster and be more motivated to work on the damn thing.</p>
