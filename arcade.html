    <h1>ARCADE</h1>
	<p> This is the video-games section of the site.<br>
	Video-games are pretty rad. I believe the interactivity provided by video-games can add an extra layer of artistic power to a story; whether through affecting the story itself, as in most 'art games', through serving as an additional pacing method to story events, as in Psychonauts or older point-and-clicks, or simply as an additional layer of enjoyment and artistic freedom, as in most everything else that's fun to play.</p>
	<img src="blinkies/milkcan-banner.gif"><br>
	<p>My favourite genres tend to be turn-based JRPGS, shoot-em-ups, point-and-click adventure-games, and business simulations. At the end of the day though I'll play anything that looks good.</p>
