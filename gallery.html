   <h1>GALLERY</h1>
   <p>I've been drawing stupid animal cartoons since quite literally as far back as I can remember. If I wanted a toy of some animal or other and I didn't have one, I'd just draw it on cardstock, cut it out, and fold the bottom into a little standee. I haven't really changed my approach much since then--I draw cool shit that makes me happy, for my own amusement.<br>
My major artistic influences are Hanna-Barbara cartoons and their various 2000s derivatives, 60s-70s marketing mascots and print-ads, classic science-fiction art, 80s-00s underground comix, designer vinyl toys of all sorts, and classic and modern skate-brand graphics (#1 Jim Phillips fan right here.) I could go on but this is already kind-of boring to about half of you so whatever.</p>
<p>I draw all my sketches on paper with whatever crappy pencil I happen to have handy. I do traditional 'hard' linework with dollar-store fineliners; for digital linework and colours, I use Clip Studio Paint 3 with occasional additions and text-effects in Affinity Designer 2.<br>
(As you can guess, I'm rather fond of vectors.)</p>
<p>I don't do any kind of commissions at the moment but I might start soonish if there's any interest. If you do want me to draw something fer ya feel free to E-mail or DM me on Discord (see my About page.)</p>
